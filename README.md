# D3plus

Original library: https://github.com/alexandersimoes/d3plus.

The update fixes all vulnerabilities found by npm audit and updates gulp to build the library without issues.

⚠️  **Version 2 Incoming**  ⚠️

This branch is for version 1, which is not being actively maintained. All development has been focused on version 2, which splits the project into [many small libraries](https://github.com/d3plus/) that are designed to work together.

There will be an announcement when the version 2 modules are feature-complete with everything from version 1, but the water is warm so don't be afraid to jump in.

### Development Environment

Clone this repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/feardarkness/d3plus
```

Clone the original repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexandersimoes/d3plus.git
```

Move into that directory:
```sh
cd d3plus
```

Install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

Run the gulp process to start development:
```sh
./node_modules/.bin/gulp
```

Gulp will run a server on your local machine at port 4000, and whenever you change a source file it will re-compile d3plus.js and reload your browser!

Additionally, the gulp process watches for any files in a directory titles "/tests". If you place all of your test .html files in a directory of that name, the gulp process will also detect any file changes and refresh the browser.


Generate the library for usage in production:
```sh
 ./node_modules/.bin/gulp release
 ```
